Hi, I'll show you how to make this command and event handler work.

* Step 1
  Go to index.js and configure your  bot status from line 54 to 57 (optional)

  * Step 2
    Go to events folder then ready.js and on line 9 change the string in console.log("Max is online")
to whatever you want in the console to show when the bot is started. (also optional )

* Step 3
  Go to secrets tab and add a secret called "token" without the apostrophes, then paste your bot's token in the value.


* Step 4
  That's all you need to do!

* To add new commands;

  Go to commands folder and add a new command file named whatever you want in js format

here's the basic command structure

const { SlashCommandBuilder } = require("@discordjs/builders");

module.exports = {
	data: new SlashCommandBuilder()
		.setName("Command name")
		.setDescription("Description of the command"),
	async execute(interation) {
		interation.reply({
			content: "The reply",
			ephemeral: true <= Set it to false if you want the reply to be visible to everyone
		});
	}
}

#If you want this code in your own bot, you can copy paste the code and install these packages.
